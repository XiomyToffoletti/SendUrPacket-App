# Testing Plan

## 1. Introduction
This testing plan aims to verify that the shipping label generation process functions correctly, ensuring proper data capture, validation, and PDF file generation.

## 2. Scope
The tests will be conducted on the "Generate Shipping Label" functionality within the desktop application.

## 3. Types of Tests
* Functional Testing: Validate that the data entry flow and PDF generation work correctly.
* Field Validation Testing: Ensure that the entered data meets the established restrictions.
* File Generation Testing: Verify that the PDF is correctly created with the entered data.
* UX/UI Testing: Assess that graphical elements are displayed correctly and are accessible.

## 4. Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Application Launch</br>

### Test Case 5: Incorrect Validation of Alphabetic Characters
**ID:** CP-05</br>

**Expected Result:**
* The system does not allow numeric characters (0-9) in the "Last Name", "First Name", "Street", "City", and "State" fields.
* Pressing numeric keys does not affect the fields.

### Test Case 6: Valid Data Entry and PDF Generation
**ID:** CP-06</br>
**Description:** Verify that the shipping label is correctly generated when valid data is entered in the mandatory fields ("Last Name", "First Name", "ID", "Phone", "Street", "Number", "City", "State", "Postal Code").</br>

* The PDF file name follows the specified format (e.g., "LastName_FirstName_DateTime").
* The PDF contains all the data entered in the mandatory fields, formatted correctly and legibly.
* Optional fields (if any) may or may not be completed, and this should not affect PDF generation.

### Test Case 7: Attempt to Generate PDF Without Completing Mandatory Fields

**Preconditions:** The application must be open.</br>
**Steps:**

***Scenario 1: All fields empty***</br>
1. Open the application.
2. Press the "Generate Shipping Label" button.
3. Verify that the system displays the error message: ***"Error, Fields marked with (*) *are required."***
4. Verify that the PDF is not generated.</br>

***Scenario 2: One mandatory field empty***</br>
1. Open the application.
2. Fill in all mandatory fields except the "Last Name" field.
4. Press the "Generate Shipping Label" button.
5. Verify that the system displays the error message: ***"Error, Fields marked with (*) *are required."***
6. Verify that the PDF is not generated.
7. Repeat ***Scenario 2*** for each of the mandatory fields: "First Name", "ID", "Phone", "Street", "Number", "City", "State", and "Postal Code".</br>

**Expected Result:**
* The system displays a clear and specific error message: ***"Error, Fields marked with (*) *are required."*** if an attempt is made to generate the label with one or more mandatory fields left empty.
* The PDF is not generated if any mandatory fields are empty.
* The error message must clearly indicate which fields are mandatory and left empty.

### Test Case 8: Reset of Form Fields After PDF Generation

**Preconditions:** The application must be open.</br>
**Steps:**
1. Execute CP-06 
2. Check that all fields in the form are reset, meaning all previously entered data is cleared.</br>

Every time a PDF is generated, all fields must be reset.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
* The application must allow valid data entry and correctly generate a PDF.
* If fields are empty, the system must display an error and prevent PDF generation.
* The PDF must contain the exact entered data.
* The PDF must be saved in the specified folder.
* The interface must be user-friendly and accessible.
